## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I have been working with html and css for some time now but I am relatively new to js. DOM manipulation, event handling are some of the most fascinating things we can do with js. Validation using js - using regular expressions to validate data is something that I got to learn in this project. I had not learnt the use of regular expressions until now. Regular expressions allow us to check for patterns in strings and learning to use one for validating emails was the highlight of the project.

### Useful resources

- [Javascript & Jquery - interactive front-end web development by Jon Duckett](https://www.javascriptbook.com/) - This is an amazing book for anyone who wishes to learn javascript. The concepts have been so clearly visualised and explained. The book is replete with different working code examples and the best thing is the website that the author has hosted on the internet. The website has all the code examples given in the book implemented to give the user a better understanding of the working of the code. I really liked this book and will definitely use it going forward.
- [HTML & CSS - design and build websites by Jon Duckett](https://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) - Yet another amazing book by Jon Duckett on HTML and CSS teaching the fundamentals of html, css and web design with a plenty of code samples and extras.
